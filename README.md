# AudioBox
A 'headless' Jukebox/Audio Player based on Node and LiquidSoap.

Specifically designed and tested on a Raspberry Pi B+ and a Raspberry Pi2

Since Node and LiquidSoap are available for Windows, OS/X and Linux, it should be possible to port this to other platforms.

This is not a simple install process, though all the pieces are available through normal install methods (either apititude/apt-get or npm).

1) Raspberry Pi B+ (or Pi2).
1) TheThingBox V1.8.0 (www.thethingbox.io) - base OS that I started from.  You should be able to use other distributions, but this one is configured for a headless environment, so does not assume you have a monitor/keyboard attached.
2)
